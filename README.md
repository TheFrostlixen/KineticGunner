Kinetic Gunner: Gunner of Angst
===============================

UNR CS 381 - Game Development Pipeline

You're one of the best fighter pilot/gunner teams in the world. This does not stop you from being filled of existential angst. One day you decide to go out and get some air to think...and since you're a fighter pilot, you grab a jet, load up some of your angstiest music, and take to the skies in the middle of hostile (???) territory.
